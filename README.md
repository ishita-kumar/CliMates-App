Market Product:
Enviroad was developed over the duration of the ‘Mobile and Pervasive Design’ course (I527), the graduate-level course taught by Dr. Patrick Shih at Indiana University (Bloomington). The application was developed following a successive design approach which included requirement gathering, needs assessment (through interviews and surveys), intensive design, and minimum-viable implementation phases. Our research process started with the aim of empowering individuals to take small actions towards mitigating a global issue. Climate Change is the defining global and environmental issue of our time.
